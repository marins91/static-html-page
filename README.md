# static-html-page
Static HTML page for an internship program

Hello, my name is Marina and this is my attempt at making a static HTML page. 


1.I used CSS as I am most familiar with it. I downloaded a Sass converter extension but for some reason, it got stuck at "Watching Sass"

2.The 3rd part of the page required changing the currency based on location of the user, but every code I found online used geolocation which required paid membership, so I left that out.

3.As you will see I definitely need to learn more about adapting the page layout to different screens :)

4.I had A LOT of fun doing this, and I am happy to learn a lot of new things
